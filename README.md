# simpleWebServer
Dead simple web server that I use to fast deploy static website / web application, mostly locally.
It's written using the awesome node.js + express.js combo. logging done via morgan.

## Usage :
* download & extract repository locally
* in terminal : `npm install && npm start` (web server started at `localhost:80`)
* in browser, type in `localhost`

*prerequist : node.js & NPM installed*

## How it work :
Simply copy-paste your website / application into the "public" folder. You can safely override the dummy files / folders in there.

## Disclaimer :
this is **NOT** intended for anything other than dev purpose, as this is **NOT SECURE AT ALL**.
If you want more, you should move to SSL / TLS secured web server.
GIYF.
